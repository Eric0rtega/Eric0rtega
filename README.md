## About Me
My name is Eric Ortega, a full time computer science student in pursuit of my Computer Science degree. I am a recent graduate of a UC Berkeley Extension Bootcamp for Data Analytics. I do not attend Berkeley but it does happen to be my dream school to recieve my degree from after transfer.
## Interests
My interests have shifted throughout the years but still have plenty of goals in mind that I am knocking out one punch at a time. Anything code or technology related will have my attention within a heartbeat (It has been tried and tested).

I love to learn so I have a collection of books and not a few, it's an entire wall. That would be my most prized posession besides family and my laptop.

I recently started a collection of vintage tech, I will build on that in the future.

Some other interests of mine are trying to fix non booting computers, ethical hacking, Raspberry Pi's, helping others when I can, entreprenuership and giving back.
## SKills
My skills currently are strongest in Data Analytics, although I have worked with numerous tools and languages to complete course work and projects.

## Current Projects
PDF Reader in Python
Personal Assistant with Python

## Thanks for stopping by!
